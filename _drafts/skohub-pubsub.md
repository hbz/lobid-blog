In the previous blog posts we have presented [SkoHub Vocabs](http://blog.lobid.org/2019/09/27/presenting-skohub-vocabs.html) and [SkoHub Editor](http://blog.lobid.org/2020/03/31/skohub-editor.html). In the final post of this SkoHub introduction series we will take a deeper look at SkoHub PubSub, the part of SkoHub that brings the novel approach of "KOS-based content subscription" into the game.

Let's refresh what SkoHub is about by quoting the gist from [the project's homepage](https://skohub.io/):

> SkoHub supports a novel approach for finding content on the web. The general idea is to extend the scope of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) to also act as communication hubs for publishers and information seekers. In effect, SkoHub allows to follow specific subjects in order to be notified when new content about that subject is published. 

Before diving into the technical implementation and protocols used, we provide an example on how this subscription, publication and notification process can be carried out in practice. Although SkoHub Pubsub is the core of the whole infrastructure and the module that connects all the other SkoHub components, it is not visible itself to end users but only in other applications which send out notifications to a specific topic or subscribe to a topic. (This is the great thing about open standards!) So, let's take a look at an example workflow involving SkoHub Editor and Mastodon to demonstrate the functionalities.

# Subscribing to a subject

In one of the mentioned previous posts we exemplary published the [Educational Subjects Classification](https://w3id.org/class/esc/scheme) with SkoHub Vocabs. Now, let's take a look at a single subject from this classification, e.g. [Library, information and archival studies](https://w3id.org/class/esc/n0322):

On the left-hand side, you can see the location of the topic in the classification hierarchy. On the right-hand side, there is some basic information on the subject: It has a URI (`https://w3id.org/class/esc/n0322`), a notation within the classification (`0322`) a preferred label (`Library, information and archival studies`) and an inbox. Taking a look at the [underlying JSON data](https://w3id.org/class/esc/n0322.json) (by adding the format suffix `.json` to the URI), I can see all this as structured data using SKOS:

```json
{
  "id":"https://w3id.org/class/esc/n0322",
  "type":"Concept",
  "followers":"https://skohub.io/followers?subject=hbz%2Fvocabs-edu%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2Fw3id.org%2Fclass%2Fesc%2Fn0322",
  "inbox":"https://skohub.io/inbox?actor=hbz%2Fvocabs-edu%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2Fw3id.org%2Fclass%2Fesc%2Fn0322",
  "prefLabel":{
    "en":"Library, information and archival studies"
  },
  "notation":[
    "0322"
  ],
  "broader":{
    "id":"https://w3id.org/class/esc/n032",
    "prefLabel":{
      "en":"Journalism and information"
    }
  },
  "inScheme":{
    "id":"https://w3id.org/class/esc/scheme",
    "title":{
      "en":"Educational Subjects Classification"
    }
  }
}
```

The `followers` gives a hint that I can somehow follow this subject. Clicking on the associated URL, I will see a JSON file containing the list of followers of this subject. I am interested in this topic and want to follow it to receive notifications about knew online resources that are published and tagged with this subject. How do I achieve this?

What I need is a client that speaks ActivityPub, in this case we will use the popular [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) service [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)). So, I open up my Mastodon client and put the topic URI into the search box:

<img src="/images/skohub-pubsub/subscribe.png" alt="Screenshot of a Mastodon search result for a topic URL with adjacent subscribe button" style="width:420px">

I click on the follow button and am now following this subject with my Mastodon account.

# Describing and announcing a resource with SkoHub Editor

Let's now switch into the role of a scholar, teacher, tutor or general interested person who has created an instructive online resource and wants to publish it to all people interested in the topic of "Library, information and archival studies". In this case, I published a [blog post about a talk at SWIB19 â€“ Semantic Web in Libraries Conference](http://blog.lobid.org/2020/01/29/skohub-talk-at-swib19.html) and want to share it with others. I somehow need to send a message to the topic's inbox, in this case I am using the SkoHub Editor (but it could be any other ActivityPub client or even the command line interface from which I publish). For the best user experience I download the SkoHub browser extension ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/skohub-extension/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skohub/ghalhmcgaicdcpmdicinaegnoanfmggd)). First, I have to configure the editor based on a schema that actually makes use of the Educational Subjects Classification. I made a [version of the default schema](https://github.com/dini-ag-kim/lrmi-profile/blob/useEsc4Subjects/draft/schemas/schema.json) that does so and now put it into the extension's settings:

<img src="/images/skohub-pubsub/configure-extension.png" alt="Screenshot of how to configure a custom schema in the SkoHub Editor extension for Firefox">

Then, I fire up the extension when visiting the web page I like to share and add data to the input form:

<img src="/images/skohub-pubsub/describing.png" alt="Describing a resource with the SkoHub Editor browser extension">

I chose the topic "Library, information and archival studies" from the suggestions in the "subject" field add information on licensing etc. and click "Publish". Now, in the background, the description of the resource is sent to the respective topic (it could be more than one) which distributes the information to all its subscribers. Thus, in the end I will receive a notification of the resource in my Mastodon timeline:

# Protocols and implementation

 We decided to use relatively new but quite often implemented social media protocols published by W3C: [ActivityPub](http://activitypub.rocks/) and [Linked Data Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/). Furthermore, we support [Webfinger](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/webfinger/) as it is needed to integrate with Mastodon.
