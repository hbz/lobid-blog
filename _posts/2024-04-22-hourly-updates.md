For lobid-gnd we fetch the GND as RDF-XML via OAI-PMH from the DNB and transform it to JSON-LD.
At SWIB 2023 a colleague from UB Münster suggested to shorten our interval for ingesting OAI-PMH updates
which we provided at a daily basis.

Now we are glad to announce that lobid-gnd provides hourly updates so you do not have to wait for the next day to get current GND data.

Have fun with it.
