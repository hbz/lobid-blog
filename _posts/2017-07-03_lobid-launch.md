We are happy to announce  the official launch of lobid-resources and lobid-organisations 2.0!

For some time we had the API in open beta and by now think that it is time to go into production. We have been writing a lot about our experiences working on the new version of these services, see the previous posts on the blog. 

Version 1.0 of the API will be up and running for some months to come. Nonetheless, people should plan switching to the newer version as we don't want to run both services in parallel for too long. As soon as we know a concrete date for shutting off the API we will let people know via the [mailing list](http://listen.hbz-nrw.de/mailman/listinfo/lobid) (German) and via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lobidorg).
