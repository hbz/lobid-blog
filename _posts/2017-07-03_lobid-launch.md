We are happy to announce the official launch of lobid-resources and lobid-organisations 2.0!

For some time we had the API and new user interfaces based on it in open beta and by now think that it is time to go into production. We have been writing a lot about our experiences working on the new version of these services, see the [previous posts on the blog](http://blog.lobid.org/).

Version 1.0 of the API will be up and running for now. Nonetheless, you should plan switching to the newer version as we won't run both services in parallel forever. As soon as we know a concrete date for shutting off the API we will let you know via the [mailing list](http://listen.hbz-nrw.de/mailman/listinfo/lobid) (German) and via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lobidorg).
