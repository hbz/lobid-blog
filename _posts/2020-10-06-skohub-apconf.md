From 2-5 October the ActivityPub conference happened online. It used a flipped classroom approach where talks would be uploaded before the conference and the live part would be Q&A sessions for each talk. On Sunday, additionally lightning talks took place and birds of a feather (bof) sessions where  – quite similar to a barcamp session – people interested in a topic could propose a session and meet with likeminded people.

The programme with links to the recordings and forum can be viewed at [https://conf.activitypub.rocks/#live](https://conf.activitypub.rocks/#live).

We had a session about SkoHub on Friday, here is our previously recorded video:

We got the impression that from people building applications form the Fediverse there is quite some interest in using experiences and approaches from the library world with regard to creating and maintaining controlled vocabularies and assigning topics. What we learned is to better prepare for such a Q&A session: Next time we would have some slides ready to introduce the basic concepts and some links to point to exemplary implementations and further information.

Different projects are already (thinking about how best) dealing with categories, taxonomies in the Fediverse:

- [**CommonsPub**](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/commonspub-and-the-quest-for-a-modular-decentralised-app-ecosystem/938) – which builds on experiences from MoodleNet – is working on "[f]ederated taxonomies for topic-based search and discovery across instances."
- The CommonsPub-based [**HAHA** Academy](https://haha.academy/) is experimenting with collaboratively created and maintained ["taxonomy of all human knowledge"](https://haha.academy/#the_knowledge).
- [**LearnAwesome.org**](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/learnawesome-org-building-a-better-goodreads-with-activitypub/946) helps people in managing and finding learning material online in very different formats. It supports following certain topics.
- The [**"Rebooting Indymedia" project**](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/the-reboot-of-the-indymedia-project/942) wants to use topic-based channels to create moderation workflows for building independent news sites from decentrally published content.
- In a related effort by Trolli Schmittlauch, the problem is addressed how to create a comprehensive **hashtag search** & subscription in a federated social network. See [this paper](https://git.orlives.de/schmittlauch/paper_hashtag_federation/src/branch/master/paper_hashtag_federation.pdf) for details.

In a birds of a feather session about [“Topics” and Services we can subscribe to](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/topics-and-services-we-can-subscribe-to/995) some of the people working on tags, controlled vocabularies etc. came together and had a fruitful exchange, sorting out the different problems and which approaches exist to address them.
