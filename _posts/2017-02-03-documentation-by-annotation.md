For the relaunch of the lobid API, we are currently trying out a rather new form of documenting the data.

- Common practice of documenting your vocabulary, application profile or metadata schema is using tables or ... -> add example
- Examples are often secondary. schema.org tries to have examples every – but often even there example are missing --> add example

Talking about documentation with [Jan Schnasse]() some time ago, I thought about putting the example into the center of documentation. 

So we did this: using production examples of our JSON data and annotating them with hypothes.is.

See e.g. the documentation for the – still officially to be launched – lobid-organisations service: http://lobid.org/organisations/api/de (Currently we have only annotations on the German version.)
